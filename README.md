# Vhack2025
Everything that you need to find for Vhack2025 ：）

Introduction

vhack_final_product == the product that contains HMM,CNN,Emsemble Model (XGboost,GradientBoost,MLP,Linear Regression,Random Forest)

vhack_final_product(alternative) == the product that contains HMM,CNN,LSTM

*All backend are only run in python, a flask app.py and templates(.html) files are provided to serve as a simple frontend.
*Only vhack_final_product & vhack_final_product(alternative serve as final products that needed to seen by judges. Others projects not prepared for Vhack2025.

Roadmap (for beginners that have 0 knowledge and prople who want to see how I learned ML trading step by step)

1. technical_analysis_simulation == projects that I used to learn basic technical analysis, an simulation for 365 days how different trading strategies work and compare their performance)

2. emsemble == emsemble model that only analyse traditional market data (OHLCV), using Linear Regression, XGboost, MLP,and Random Forest.

3. on_chain == prototype version for vhack_final_product

4. ai_model == first try in trading bitcoin using DQN

#by the way, every projects here are gifted with a simple front end that works... so if you are free maybe you can try tooo.
